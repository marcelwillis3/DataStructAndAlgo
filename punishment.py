# Author: Marcel Willis

# Create a function called punishment with no inputs
def punishment():
    # Definite loop for 100 times; start at 0 and end at 99.
    for i in range(0,100):
        # Accumulate the variable i for printing purposes
        i += 1
        # Print the line number for reference, followed by the statement to be repeated.
        print(i,"I will never spam my friends again.")
# Call the function to execute the above actions
punishment()
